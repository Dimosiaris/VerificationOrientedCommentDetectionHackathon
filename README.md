# Verification Oriented Comment Detection

This repository contains the source code for the EURASIP's hackathon

## Objective 

Build a system that automatically verifies a fake video by a comment.

## Abstract

Users are expressing their opinions via the comment section. If the video is fake then many users will comment that this is indeed fake. So our mission is to find a generally accepted and unbiased comment that will act as a verification comment to the fake video so other viewers can see it and not fall for the trap.

## Technologies

We generated a YouTube API key where we got the comments the likes and replies of each tested video and organized them to a Panda dataframe. After clearing the data, we searched for the keywords in the comments and based on the likes and the replies of the comment we added weights. Lastly, for the training we used an SVC(Support Vector Classifier) to classify the comment section to useful and not useful comments. The useful cluster was generated by certain keywords in the comments such as "fake","propaganda","lies".
